# Stock-Analysis
## Stock Analysis VBA Challenge
### Overview of Project: 
Explain the purpose of this analysis. Taking the 2017 and 2018 stock market data and getting the results of their Total Daily Volume and Return all within VBA Excel. To get an accurate representation of this data I refactored the code from the begining part of the worksheet to preform both 2017 and 2018 results.
## Results
Using images and examples of your code, compare the stock performance between 2017 and 2018, as well as the execution times of the original script and the refactored script.

## Summary 
In this project the first set of code had to be refactored 
### What are the advantages or disadvantages of refactoring code?
The advantages is that for VBA Excel the code all being within one marco it makes it better to read and better to know that you have all of your steps within this one code.
### How do these pros and cons apply to refactoring the original VBA script?
The pro's are that the code's do not have to be copied twice creating no cofusion when reading through the marco. With writing the code twice there can be more room for error and here you get the outcomes you want using only one refactored code. The con's can be that long line of code's can be hard to not only make sure you are covering every step needed to preform in you excel worksheet but making sure nothing gets misssed. I myself, as getting more familiar with code understand the benefits that refactoring was more difficult for me while trying to understand how to run both 2017 and 2018 all within the same code. I was finding it easier to do seperate but it would not only take longer but be very long codes.
